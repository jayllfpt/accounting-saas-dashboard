# Implementation Plan for Top 3 Features

Based on the source code structure and the three prioritized features (FR-04, FR-01, FR-05), here's a detailed implementation plan that breaks down the work into manageable phases.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Data Processing (1-2 days)

  ```
  dash
  dash-bootstrap-components
  pandas
  plotly
  dash-table
  dash-extensions
  reportlab (for PDF export)
  ```
- Create basic app initialization in main.py

### 1.2 Data Processing Foundation
- Implement data loading and basic processing in utils/data_processing.py
- Create data transformation functions for different views
- Implement basic financial calculations in utils/calculations.py

## Phase 2: FR-04 - Transaction Search and Filtering (3-4 days)

- Create filter components in components/filters.py:
  - Date range picker
  - Account dropdown
  - Category dropdown
  - Transaction type dropdown
  - Customer/Vendor dropdown
  - Payment method dropdown
  - Free text search for Description

### 2.2 Results Display
- Implement interactive data table in components/data_table.py
- Add sorting and pagination functionality
- Create layout in layouts/transaction_search.py

### 2.3 Search Logic
- Implement search callbacks in callbacks/search_callbacks.py
- Connect filters to data table updates
- Add reset filters functionality

### 2.4 Testing and Refinement
- Test with various filter combinations
- Optimize for performance with large datasets
- Add loading indicators for better UX

## Phase 3: FR-01 - Financial Overview Dashboard (3-4 days)

### 3.1 Key Metrics Components
- Create summary cards for:
  - Total Revenue (Credit)
  - Total Expenses (Debit)
  - Net Profit/Loss
  - Account balances

### 3.2 Visualization Components
- Implement in components/charts.py:
  - Revenue vs. Expenses bar chart
  - Category distribution pie chart
  - Transaction trend line chart
  - Top expenses/income sources

### 3.3 Dashboard Layout
- Create main dashboard layout in layouts/overview_dashboard.py
- Implement time period selector (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Arrange components in a logical, user-friendly layout

### 3.4 Dashboard Interactivity
- Implement callbacks in callbacks/overview_callbacks.py
- Connect time period selector to chart updates
- Add drill-down capabilities from charts to transaction details

## Phase 4: FR-05 - Financial Reports Generation (2-3 days)

### 4.1 Report Configuration Interface
- Create report configuration components:
  - Report type selector (Income Statement, Cash Flow, etc.)
  - Time period selector
  - Grouping options (by Category, Account, etc.)
  - Format options (CSV, PDF)

### 4.2 Report Generation Logic
- Implement report generation functions in utils/export.py
- Create CSV export functionality
- Implement PDF report generation with reportlab

### 4.3 Report Layout and Design
- Design report templates for different report types
- Create preview functionality before export
- Implement layouts/reports.py

### 4.4 Export Functionality
- Implement download callbacks in callbacks/report_callbacks.py
- Add progress indicators for report generation
- Implement error handling for export process

## Phase 5: Integration and Navigation (1-2 days)

### 5.1 Application Navigation
- Create header component with navigation in components/header.py
- Implement page routing in main.py
- Add breadcrumbs for navigation context

### 5.2 Feature Integration
- Connect all features through a cohesive navigation system
- Ensure consistent data flow between features
- Implement cross-feature functionality (e.g., from overview to detailed reports)

### 5.3 Styling and UI Refinement
- Create consistent styling in assets/css/styles.css
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Add loading states and transitions

## Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (2-3 days)

### 6.1 Functional Testing
- Test each feature with various data scenarios
- Verify calculations and report accuracy
- Test filter combinations and edge cases

### 6.2 Performance Optimization
- Optimize data loading and processing
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Improve rendering performance for large datasets

### 6.3 Final Refinements
- Address any usability issues
- Add helpful tooltips and instructions
- Ensure consistent error handling

## Total Estimated Time: 12-18 days

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the three prioritized features. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental development and testing. The plan focuses on creating a solid foundation first, then implementing each feature in a logical sequence, and finally integrating everything into a cohesive application.
