Use a prompt to split code to build a dashboard for an Accounting SaaS company. And give an explanation of how it was done.

"Use a prompt to split code"
This means you need to write a prompt that guides an AI (such as an LLM like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, or an AI agent) to automatically generate and split the code into different components.

"To build a dashboard for an Accounting SaaS company"
The dashboard is designed for an accounting-focused SaaS company, so it must include financial-related features such as:

Displaying revenue, expenses, and profits
Managing invoices and cash flow
Financial reporting
Accounting data visualization with charts
"And give the explanation on how it was done"
You need to explain the process, including:

How the prompt was written to split the code
How the AI uses the prompt to segment the code
Why this approach was chosen
